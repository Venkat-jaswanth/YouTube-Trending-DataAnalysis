# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes trending videos on YouTube, focusing on various aspects such as category distribution, publication times, and view counts. By leveraging YouTube's API, I've collected data on trending videos and performed comprehensive analysis to uncover interesting trends and patterns.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Utilized YouTube's API to fetch data on trending videos, including information such as video titles, categories, publication dates, view counts, and more.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis by handling missing values, converting data types, and creating additional columns for deeper insights (e.g., publish hour).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the dataset to identify trends and patterns, including:
  - Distribution of video categories among trending videos
  - Analysis of view counts, like counts, and comment counts
  - Insights into the optimal time for publishing videos to maximize engagement

## Key Findings

- **Category Distribution**: The majority of trending videos fall under the categories of "Music," "Entertainment," and "Comedy." This indicates a strong audience preference for these genres.
- **Publication Timing**: Videos published during peak hours (early evenings) tend to receive higher engagement, suggesting a strategic time for content release.
- **Engagement Metrics**: A positive correlation was observed between the number of views and likes, indicating that higher visibility often leads to increased viewer interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **YouTube Data API**: For fetching trending video data

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the types of content that trend on YouTube and the optimal times for publishing videos. Such insights can be instrumental for content creators aiming to maximize their reach and engagement on the platform.

## Future Work

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of comments to gauge audience reactions.
- **Longitudinal Analysis**: Tracking changes in trending content over time to identify evolving viewer preferences.
